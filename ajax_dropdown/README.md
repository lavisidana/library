# Dropdown using ajax and bootstrap.

In this module dropdown updates values depending on the selction of any one dropdown.
I have used four drop down to update others when one is selected, Values are getting updated using ajax.
I am also adding csv in the same folder which is of sample data. Try out by yourself in you test environment or local host. if need any help do let me know.
Shortly i am also going to add one more type of drop down which will show the update the next value depending on the first selection in my case first brand will be selected than model after that year then color. That is old school way.
